4. Describe the best project you have worked on, including links if any.


Participated in Hackathon (MLH - Hack 36) where I along with my teammates designed a full-stack Ecommerce
web app named Krishical that provides goods and services to the farmers and to all those who are part of the 
Agriculture Sector.  For the front-end part HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and Javascript was used whereas for back-end part node.js and MongoDB was used.
